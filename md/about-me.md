# 🙋🏻‍♂️ About Me

I first started to learn about the basics of programming while I was working as
a Research Intern at a computational physics lab at my college. I was fascinated
by the fact that how software development can impact a lot of people and how the
skills are applicable in numerous areas. After I graduated, I led an actuarial
modeling software migration project at an actuarial consulting firm called Milliman
where I was fortunate enough to work with a lot of things despite being an entry
level software engineer. Currently, I’m looking for a role where I can hone my
skills in Frontend and Devops as well as deepen my knowledge in Backend development
to become a T shape full stack developer.
