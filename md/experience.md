# ðŸ’¼ Experience

## Software Engineer @ Milliman

### *Full-time, Nov 2021 - Apr 2023*

* Developed and maintained actuarial modeling and insurance reserving software, the primary tool for actuaries. The software features a comprehensive code editor for Visual Basic for Application (VBA), version control, debugging, and a transpiler converting VBA to C++ and then to machine code. It can also run the code on various environments such as on a Desktop leveraging multi-threading, or with a scheduler and a server leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) and report the result. Resulted in a significant reduction in clients' CPU usage, up to 98%
* Contributed to the renewal of the actuarial modeling software, collaborating with actuaries in a cross-functional team. Involved ideation, implementation of new features, wireframing, technology migration (e.g., from .NET framework to Node.js), and data migration between different databases
* Played a key role in acquiring an estimated 50% of the total market share for the developed product
* Architected backend services using Microservices architecture to enhance scalability, maintainability, and flexibility
* Contributed to database schema design and query optimization to improve the performance of slow queries
* Modified parts of open-source software, such as TypeORM, and integrated them with proprietary software as needed
* Designed, implemented, and documented various types of APIs, including GraphQL, RPC, and REST
* Improved the continuous integration (CI) process by implementing build and test automation pipelines with Jenkins and Github Webhooks, utilizing declarative pipelines to enhance maintainability
* Conducted seminars within the team on topics such as Node.js internals, JavaScript/TypeScript, and NestJS
* Refactored the legacy codebase and fixed numerous bugs, ranging from GUI to concurrency issues
* Introduced various diagrams (ER diagrams, Class diagrams, etc.) and detailed documentation to enhance collaboration between developers and actuaries
* Analyzed bottlenecks in the team's software development process and enhanced version control strategies
* Technologies: TypeScript, Javascript, Node.js, NestJS, GraphQL, MongoDB, Git, Postman, Docker, Linux, Azure, C#, VB.NET, WinForms, DevExpress, SQLite, LiteDB, MS SQL Server, GitHub Webhooks, Jenkins, Swagger

## Machine Learning Engineer Intern @ ITS

### *Internship, Jun 2019 â€“ Dec 2019*

* Implemented a pipeline for aggregating, preprocessing, and storing industrial data in the form of multivariate time series
* Developed a classification machine learning model using the k-NN algorithm and achieved 97% classification accuracy
* Technologies: Python, MySQL, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas

## Undergraduate Research Intern @ Nanostructured Polymer Materials Theory Lab (UNIST)

### *Internship, Sep 2018 â€“ Jun 2019*

* Researched and implemented numerical simulation algorithms, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm or Wolff algorithm (Monte Carlo method), to simulate, visualize, and analyze phase transitions of a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics (Ising Model)
* Technologies: Python, Fortran, C++, Linux
